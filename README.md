*I love music, especially finding new music and listening to music. Especially when I'm in a mood. What kind of mood? Any kind of mood! I find it therapeutic listening to certain kind of songs depending on my mood. So what if there was an app that allowed you to do that without going through the trouble of finding or creating your own playlist for it?*

HERES THE SOLUTION: 
This is an app that uses a emotion-detection API and Spotify API to give you playlists off of Spotify based on your "mood" from the emotions detected off of your face.

1. To start, you can click on the "get-started" button. 
2. To use, you will need to add a 1. emotion-detection API key, 2. Spotify ID, 3. Spotify Secret. 
3. Once you have those three keys in, click enter.
4. Then you have the option to either "use webcam" or "upload" your own picture.
5. After you get your picture, the app will continue to retrieve emotion data and playlists with the keyword of the emotion that was detected. 

Hope you enjoy!
